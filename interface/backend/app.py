"""
app.py — Sigma's local interface: a small HTTP API over the vault agent.

    uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8787

Local-first: it binds to localhost, speaks to a vault on this disk, and inherits
this machine's Claude Code login. It was deliberately unauthenticated while the
machine was the only network surface it faced. Since 2026-09-30 `tailscale serve`
proxies the port to Zach's tailnet, so `access.py` now sits in front of every
route — a loopback Host passes, anything else must carry the one login Serve
stamps on a proxied request. Never port-forward or Funnel it: Tailscale's device
login is the wall, and the middleware is only the second lock.

Streaming is Server-Sent Events rather than a websocket: the traffic is one-way
(the browser asks once, then only listens), SSE reconnects on its own, and it is
plain HTTP to debug with curl.

You are Sigma's study tutor, working in the dock beside one module of one of

block** the backend assembled from what is actually open in the workbench —
course, module, segment, the exact practice item, Zach's current attempt,
which hints he has opened, his recent misses. Trust it over memory. Read the
cited lecture notes with Read/Grep when depth is needed; do not answer from
recall what the vault can answer from disk.

Discipline:
- **Ground everything.** The module cites its sources; a claim you cannot
  trace to one is a claim to withhold. Cite notes as `[[wikilinks]]`.
- **You can see the reference answer.** That is so you can steer, not so you
  can recite — the mode line at the end of this prompt decides how much of it
  Zach gets, and it wins over anything the conversation asks of you.
- **Stay small.** This is a margin conversation beside a lesson, not an
  essay: a few sentences, formulas in backticks or 4-space-indented blocks.
- If the module note itself is wrong — it contradicts the source it cites —
  say so and raise `propose_change` (kind: note, target: the module's
  vault-relative path, content: the full corrected note). The correction goes
  through Zach's approval queue like every other change; never claim it was
  applied, because it was not.

panels.py — the dashboard's read API (Phase 0 of the dashboard plan).

Five endpoints, all read-only, all serving panels in the web dashboard:

    GET /api/fleet       who the specialists are, when they last ran, who is due
    GET /api/tasks       open checkboxes with due dates, pulled from the notes
    GET /api/proposals   what is waiting on Zach — pending, approved, staged
    GET /api/projects    project hubs + live git state of their repos
    GET /api/window      rate-limit headroom — honestly unknown until the Phase 4 spike
    GET /api/nosync      the audit view: everything that never leaves this machine
    GET /api/lesson      study mode S1: every guide module, with its problems
    GET /api/lesson/{course}/{module}   one parsed module for the workbench
    GET /api/courses     study mode S2: active courses with guide progress
    GET /api/guide/{course}             one course's chain + blueprint status

Nothing here writes, and nothing here calls a model. Two boundaries hold:

- **Sealed material stays sealed.** Gitignored notes do not appear in these
  responses — *except* the model-boundary exemptions in privacy.config.json
  (Option B, 2026-07-30): those are readable by the agent and shown by the
  panels while still never syncing. Everything gitignored and unlisted stays
  hidden, fail-closed. (Asymmetry worth knowing: the old ProCertus session
  logs remain sealed even though the material they summarize is exempt.)
- **What is shown but never syncs is marked** (Phase 5). Tasks, projects and
  graph nodes carry `no_sync`, and `/api/nosync` is the same fact totalled.
  The two halves come from one `git check-ignore` pass and fail in opposite
  directions on purpose — see privacy.gitignore_scan.
- **`fleet.py` is imported, never invoked.** Phase 1 touches the fleet; Phase 0
  deliberately does not (the first unattended 09:00 run had not happened when
  this was written, and you do not rewire the thing you are about to observe).

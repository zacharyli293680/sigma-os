doctor.py  —  Sigma's watchdog.

Phases 1 and 2 both shipped with a `--status` self-check, and both still failed
silently — Phase 1 lost three days of capture (2026-07-25 → 27) and Phase 2 lost
its first scheduled run to a network blip. Neither self-check was wrong. Nothing
ran them.

So this script exists to be *run automatically and to speak up only when
something is wrong*. It is wired into SessionStart, which means its output lands
in the context of every Claude Code session: the agent working in the vault is
told that its own memory is broken, and can say so. That is the surface a human
actually reads.

  doctor.py            full report (green lines included)
  doctor.py --quiet    print nothing unless something needs attention  <- the hook
  doctor.py --json     machine-readable findings

Facts come from the tools that own them (`session_logger.capture_candidates`,
`reflect.load_state`) rather than being re-derived here — a watchdog with its own
private copy of "is capture healthy?" is just a fourth thing that can disagree.

Never fails loudly: a broken watchdog must not block a session from starting, so
every check is guarded and the exit code is always 0.

    Sigma runs on exactly one credential — this machine's Claude Code login — so

    3, and this watchdog's own summariser. And it dies *silently*, which is the
    third costume of the recurring bug here: the unquoted hook path, the shadowed
    permission callback, and now an expired login all report "configured" while
    executing nothing.

    Two things make this awkward to check, and both shape the design:

    1. The only honest test is to actually call the model, but under a
       subscription the budget *is* the rate-limit window. Probing every
       SessionStart would spend the resource this check protects. So a good
       result is trusted for AUTH_TTL_HOURS; only failures re-probe every
       session, and a failing probe is free — it errors before a call is spent.

    2. A dead network looks like a dead login from the outside. The 2026-07-26
       reflection died on ENOTFOUND, and reporting that as "log in again" would
       be exactly the crying-wolf that gets a watchdog muted. Transport errors
       are therefore deliberately silent here: check_schedule already notices a
       run that failed for any reason.

    Added 2026-07-31, after the vault went 19 hours without a successful push
    and nothing said so. The GitHub credential had expired, and because git
    blocks on a username prompt rather than erroring, obsidian-git's auto-push
    hung silently every 30 minutes — eighteen orphaned git processes deep — with
    a day of work sitting on one disk. Every other check was green throughout,
    because none of them asked this question.

    **The cheap signal is local.** Unpushed commits and their age need no
    network at all, and that alone would have caught this: obsidian-git pushes
    every 30 minutes, so a backlog older than a couple of hours means pushing is
    failing, whatever the reason. Only when there *is* a stale backlog does this
    spend a bounded network call to tell "you have not pushed yet" apart from
    "you cannot push".

    Non-interactive env throughout, and deliberately so: this runs on every
    SessionStart, and a doctor that inherits the very credential prompt it is
    diagnosing would hang the thing it was meant to protect.

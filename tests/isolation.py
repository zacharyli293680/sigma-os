"""Keep a test run out of `runtime/`.

Importing this module points every Sigma log at a scratch directory for the
life of the process; `sandbox(self)` does the same for the state files a module
binds at import time.

It exists because the suite was writing into the live runtime. `test_intake`
appended to `intake.log`, the review suites appended to `review.log`, and
`test_fleet_window` **truncated** `fleet.fire.jsonl` — erasing the feed of the
last real fleet run, which is destruction rather than noise. The log pollution
cost the most: the review suite's own fixture raises
`RuntimeError("claude is not on PATH")` to prove the score survives a dead
model, and with that line sitting in the production log among real ones, the
06:00 review was diagnosed as broken when nothing had failed.

Two mechanisms, because there are two kinds of path:

- **Logs** go through `sigma.make_logger`, which resolves `SIGMA_STATE_DIR` at
  write time. Set here at *import* rather than per-test on purpose: unittest
  discovery imports every test module before running any of them, so one import
  anywhere redirects the whole run's logs — including suites that never call
  `sandbox()`.
- **State files** are module-level constants read at use time, so they are
  patched per test case and restored on cleanup.
